This page is designed with two categories: non-IT and IT. When a person clicks on either category, a corresponding list is displayed in the sidebar. Upon selecting an item from the list on the right side, a description of the chosen item is shown. This interactive design allows users to easily navigate and access information based on their interests and preferences.
